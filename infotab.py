					"new key in the data dictionary. Now adjust the FFT crop bounds either smaller" \
					" or larger depending on your expected twist angle. You can always run it and" \
					" adjust, though FFTs take ~20 s to run. Increase the center mask radius to " \
					"remove the low-frequency signals from the center of the FFT, improving clarity" \
					" of the actual peaks. You can also use the center line height mask to block out" \
					" intense signals from the fast-scan direction lines. Hover over the peaks in the FFT " \
					"and look at the upper right " \
					"corner to see their position on the figure. Type them into the X and Y boxes for " \
					"the correct peak in the lower left section. Test all peaks to confirm " \
					"that you picked decent locations. Reduce the crop radius for specific peaks if " \
					"they are close to other noise. Once you like the location of the peaks, save the " \
					"values. This writes them to the dictionary, and then you can recall them later. " \
					"Run fit. This will take several minutes, which is why you saved " \
					"the peaks earlier. Once the program finishes and you like the results, hit save " \
					"values to keep them in the dictionary."
